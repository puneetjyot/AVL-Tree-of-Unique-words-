# AVL-Tree-of-Unique-words-
Your program should go through the input file line by line. For each line, extract each word, and insert that word, along with it's location into an AVL tree. Each element of the AVL tree should contain a unique word and a linked list of line numbers where that word occurs. If word already exists in the AVL Tree, simply add the new line number to the existing node. If a word appears on the same line twice, it should only have one entry in the list for that line. When you have finished, print out each unique word that appeared in the input file along with a list of line numbers on which that word appears.
